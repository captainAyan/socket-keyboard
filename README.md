    Socket-Keyboard is keyboard using websockets <b>(Not active)</b>

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies of the server and the client
- Run server using `npm start`
- Build the client using `nexe`

**Note :** The website and the `client.exe` will make the api requests to the actual hosted api (socketkeyboard.herokuapp.com) not the local one.

🙏🥺 Consider starring this project.

👉👈 Also consider contribution, I could use some help.
